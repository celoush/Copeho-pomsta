Only one thing could make me come back to Nogova. The revenge. 
I must deal with all of them. Nobody can survive. First, I will head to the ruins above the bay. They were always hiding there. Then, I will go to that damned farm and villa. 
On my way to Lipany, I will finish the motorbikers. I will keep the most important one for the end. That will be my revenge.<br>

One day, peace will commence. One day, everything will be over. One day, noone will be shooting. But that day is not today.
